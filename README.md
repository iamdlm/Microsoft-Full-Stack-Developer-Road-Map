# Microsoft Full Stack Web Developer Road Map
The purpose of this roadmap is to guide anyone in their journey to becoming Full-Stack Web Developer, with a clear focus on Microsoft technologies.

A Full-Stack Web Developer is someone who is able to work on both the front-end and back-end portions of an application. Front-end generally refers to the portion of an application the user will see or interact with, and the back-end is the part of the application that handles the logic, database interactions, user authentication, server configuration, etc. 

Being a Full-Stack Developer doesnâ€™t mean that you have necessarily mastered everything required to work with the front-end or back-end, but it means that you are able to work on both sides and understand what is going on when building an application.

If you want to become a Full-Stack Web Developer and land your first job, below is a study guide with a list of things you should learn.
